Welcome!
Welcome!
Inspect her at your leisure.
Viserys of the House Targaryen, the third of that name. King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.
Mighty Khal! Hello! I tremble in your presence!
Respect to you, Magister. You seem healthy.
Thank you, Great Khal! I have suffered from no sickness, thanks to the sun, the moon and the stars. The sun is bright today! It is pleased by this marriage. Does it please you, Khal?
We will find out, Magister.
Indeed, you will, Khal, I promise you! And have you seen your bride yet? She's standing over there, great Khal. Can you see her? She's beautiful, beautiful…!
I have eyes, don't I?
Of course, of course! No disrespect, great Khal! Your word is death! Now! May I introduce you to your bride-to-be?
I'll follow you.
Marvelous! Come, Mighty Khal!
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Giddyup!
Hyup, hyup, giddyup!
Whoa!
Easy, easy, easy…
Nch, nch!
Welcome, Mighty Khal!
I present to you: Viserys of the House Targaryen, the third of his name. The Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and the Protector of the Realm, presents his sister Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone.
Look at her hair!
Her hair is silver like a blade!
Her eyes are purple like gems!
Heh! Look! The lamb trembles!
She's afraid!
Shush!
Inspect her at your leisure.
Hey. Any for me?
Do you want to die today?!
Do you?
Sheepfucker…
I think I see her!
Where?!
There!
No, that's not her…
Huh…
Go there!
Stop!
Stop!
Get away from me, pest!
Help move this!
Come help move this!
Quiet!
Silence!
Shut up!
Give that to me!
No!
Yes!
Never!
Kill him!
Kill that fool!
Bring me his head!
Play music!
Dance!
Put the gifts there!
Get the food!
Slaughter that sheep!
Feast!
Silence the horses!
Drum!
You've got more bells, Jono!
Some pathetic fool spit at me while I was walking here, so I took his tongue—and his head with it!
Davo! How many girls have you fucked?
I lost count! There're too many!
Try the lamb, Asho!
It's very moist, Khal!
Kino, you stallion! Let's hear your bells!
Ha, ha! For the Khal!
Your arakh has seen blood today, Tasho!
Yes, but my cock hasn't seen any pussy yet!
Sakatto! You haven't eaten yet! Eat! Are you a woman?
I will eat all the food here, and my stomach still will not be full! You will see, Mighty Khal!
Dance! Dance!
Go! Go!
Wonderful!
Catch!
Catch it! Catch it!
The Khal is pleased.
Hey!
Hey, baby!
Hey, beautiful!
Hey! You got a hole I can dig?
Look at those breasts!
I'd like to take a bite out of those pears!
My horse is riding for her!
I want that one!
No! That one's prettier!
Fools! That one's the prettiest!
I'm gonna bend her like a sapling!
Eh… Her skinny legs suit you and your skinny dick.
That one will be mine!
Mount her!
Yeah!
Unhand my woman, little boy!
Shut your mouth, eunuch! The girl is mine!
Let's see if my blade will teach you the proper respect, little boy!
I hope the arakh in your hand is sharper than the one in your pants, or I won't feel the thrust!
I will see your blood today, fool!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
You're nothing!
We're gonna see guts on the ground today!
Fight! Fight!
Eviscerate him!
He's strong!
Argh!
He's hurt!
Stand up! Are you a man or a boy?!
Blood! I see blood!
Cut his braid!
He's fallen!
A great man! A great man!
Now that's a real man!
Take his bells! They're yours now!
Fuck that girl!
She's yours!
Can you see the little bride?
I can! She's as thin as a gopher!
Ha! The Khal's massive cock is going to split her in two tonight.
ále! Hash yéri char nórethi
I heard that it's silver like a blade.
I can't see; it's too dark…
Too many people…
Do you think she bleeds silver?
From where?
Either way, the Khal's gonna find out tonight!
Ha! I hope her back is strong, that Andahl!
And her thighs!
I just do not see how that Andahl womb can carry the glorious seed of our Khal…
We must wait and be patient. We will see…
Come.
Good.
My life for your life, mighty Khal!
The pride of my family for the pride of the khalasar.
A medallion of the sun for your new moon, my Khal.
A swift stallion for your swift arm, great warrior.
Violet crystals for her violet eyes, my master.
A sharp arakh for a sharp son, great rider.
Painful death to your enemies, master hunter!
For you, Khaleesi.
A strong medallion belt for a strong wife, Khaleesi!
A purple vest for your purple eyes, Beautiful One.
The softest fur for the softest skin, Kind One.
Silk cloth for your silky hair, Silver One.
Silver rings for you, Good Woman.
Needles for your thread, Star Child.
The most beautiful feathers for the most beautiful Khaleesi, Moon Child.
Slippers for your feet, Khaleesi.
On account of your wedding, this gown I give you, Good Khaleesi.
Sweetness for your sweetness, Khaleesi.
Purple for your purple eyes, Flower Child.
A whip to bloody the backs of the enemy.
An arakh to slice through the bones of the enemy.
A double-curved dragonbone bow to penetrate the chests of the enemy.
This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, O blood of my blood, but I am a woman. Give this to my husband and not to me.
My Khaleesi.
It pleases me to be able to teach you, Khaleesi.
Good. Come with me, maids.
How are those useful?
The knight has given the Khaleesi stories from the Seven Kingdoms in the Common Tongue. It is a sentimental gift.
Goodness, Khal!
They're dragon eggs from the Shadow Lands. Quite beautiful… Trinkets? They please the Khaleesi, you can see. I got a good deal, no?
Move for the Khal!
Ahh…!
Silver for the silver of your hair.
Eyop!
Heh! Can she even ride?
Look out for the Khaleesi!
Move for the Khaleesi!
Hey! She can ride!
Ride, Silver One! Ride!
Go! Go!
Wow! She jumped it!
Excellent!
Long life for the Khaleesi!
She says you have given her the wind, Great Khal.
Splendid.
Your mount, Khal.
Giddyup!
Hunt well, Khal!
Whoa!
By the sun, moon and stars…
This beauty is greater than words…
With this night, I will die happy. With you, I want nothing more; I will call on the fire.
My life for your life, my moon; my heart.
Yes.
No.
Come forward, Jorah the Andahl!
Approach, Jorah of the Andahls!
Step forward, Jorah of the Andahls!
Stand before me, Jorah of the Andahls!
Present yourself, Jorah of the Andahls!
Stop!
No more!
My horse!
These three medallions say that he will fall.
Your satchel of jewels if I'm right.
My dun for your dapple?
I'll take that cat's claw necklace from you when he dies.
I see blood in his eyes. He will not fall.
No way!  That is the stronger man.
Shit!
Damn!
Do you desire his death?
Do you desire his death, Khaleesi?
Should I take his head from him?
Do you want the head?
Should I take the air from him?
Should I kill him?
Should he die?
Do you desire that he die?
Maybe the ear will listen if it's liberated from the head
You should take the ear. That will convince him that he will be respectful.
Take the ear, khaleesi, and so teach him respect!
Take the ear, khaleesi, and so teach him respect
Indeed!
The Khaleesi doesn't want that Viserys will be harmed.
Huh! Cricket man!
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Giddyup!
Hyup, hyup, giddyup!
Nch, nch!
It's a boy.
How do you know?
I…really knows.
Take…the horse.
Take his steed.
By your word.
Slow.
A good weapon for a rider.
Iron suit.
Full metal.
Metal shell.
Steel dress.
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses. Steel dresses
My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
Fast.
I've heard your father was a famous warrior.
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
There are no rabbits here.
A blessing from the Great Stallion.
You miss your own family.
The prince rides!
A boy! A boy! A strong boy!
Can she do it?
She's going to retch! I can see it!
The Khaleesi is strong! She can do it!
Go! Go!
Do it! Do it!
A boy! A boy! A strong boy!
The prince is riding!
I have seen his face, and heard the thunder of his hooves!
As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him the khalasar covers the earth—men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass.
Fierce as a storm this prince will be.
His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief.
The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name.
The prince is riding, and he will be the Stallion who Mounts the World!
The Stallion who Mounts the World!
A prince rides inside me! And he shall be named Rhaego!
Khaleesi! Khaleesi!
Moon of my life!
Mother of my son!
Container of my seed!
Long life to the prince!
Pride of the Khalasar!
Courage and glory!
Excellent!
The Stallion who Mounts the World—and a thousand women as well!
Did you see the khaleesi?
She showed that heart no mercy!
This is day of days, and my son is the Khal of Khals!
Give me meat!
Did you hear the name? Rhaego! Rhaego the Stud!
Get the food!
Give me meat!
She's my woman, that one there. I will have her tonight!
Mare's milk! Bring it here!
To the Khaleesi!
To Rhaego!
Night of nights!
And if I win, then you have to bed that ugly trader—the one that was selling dates and figs at the Western Market!
My dapple for your dun. What do you say?
I certainly was in the right.
Is the meat ready yet?
Look at this walker!
He brings his steel here!
The khal should take his hand…
The fool! The disrespectful fool!
By the Mother of Mountains!
The panting limper…
Coward!
Look! The Cart King: He walks! His feet aren't sore anymore, eh…?
Look! The Sorefoot King! He walks!
There is a place for you: There, with the short haired cowards.
Coward!
He disrespects Vaes Dothrak!
He disrespects the Khal!
He must die for this!
Release your steel, fool!
He's insane, this Cart King!
The foreigner says that he wants a crown—that he wants what he traded for…or he will take back the Khaleesi.
He says that he won't take back the prince.
He says that he will cut the prince out of the Khaleesi and leave him to you.
I will give him what he wants.
I will give him a golden crown and men will tremble when they see it!
Take hold of him.
Empty that pot!
The Stallion who Mounts the World has no need of iron chairs.
The land ends at the Black Salt Sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
A khal does not need a chair to sit upon. He needs only a mount.
And so you tell me this: That this merchant, this…coward from the lands across the Black Salt Sea tried to give wine to the Khaleesi, and that this drink was poisoned?
He almost brought me to his wife.
I will make for you a cloak of its skin, Moon of My Life.
Jorah of the Andahls told me about the occurrence.
Jorah of the Andahls… To you I say this: Choose any horse you like from my herd. It is yours. I make this gift to you for what you did.
And to my son, the Stallion who will Mount the World: To him I will also pledge a gift.
To him I will give this iron chair upon which his mother's father sat.
I will give to him the Seven Kingdoms.
I, Drogo, will do this.
I will take my khalasar west, to where the world ends, and ride the wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea, like no khal has done before.
I will kill the men who wear iron suits and tear down their stone houses.
I will rape their women, take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods to Vaes Dothrak.
This I vow, I, Drogo son of Bharbo.
This I swear before the Mother of Mountains, as the stars witness from the heavens.
The Stallion who Mounts the World has no need of iron chairs.
According to the prophecy, the Stallion will ride to the ends of the earth.
The land ends at the Black Salt Sea.
No horse can cross the poison water.
There are a thousand ships and more in the Free Cities: Wooden horses that fly across the sea…
We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
It's not a chair, it's a…
A chair for a king to sit on. Or a queen.
A khal does not need a chair to sit upon.
He needs only a mount.
Dates! Dates and figs! Very fresh!
Vests! New and stylish! Vests! You need a new and stylish vest!
Buy a new belt! It will change your life!
Buy a new ring or I'll kill myself!
Fish! Fresh fish! Ocean fish! River fish! Salmon and catfish!
The best spices! Spices from different lands! Spices for cooking! The best spices!
Say 'Daenerys'! Say it: Daenerys! Ah, good bird!
A gift for you, Irri.
Oooh! Ahhh!
Stylish!
I want one of those!
Sweet reds! I have sweet reds from Lys, from Volantis and from the Arbor! Tyroshi pear brandy! Andahlish sours! I have them! I have them!
A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, kind one. One taste and you will name your child after me.
Aggo: Put down that cask.
Khaleesi, no! Your hands!
You're hurt.
The Khal wants you…
And so you tell me this: That this merchant, this…coward from the lands across the Black Salt Sea tried to give wine to the Khaleesi, and that this drink was poisoned?
You brought me a lion.
He almost brought me to his wife.
I will make for you a cloak of its skin, Moon of My Life.
Jorah of the Andahls told me about the occurrence.
This poisoner was the first, but he will not be the last. A man will die for a lordship.
Jorah of the Andahls… To you I say this: Choose any horse you like from my herd. It is yours. I make this gift to you for what you did.
And to my son, the Stallion who will Mount the World: To him I will also pledge a gift.
To him I will give this iron chair upon which his mother's father sat.
I will give to him the Seven Kingdoms.
I, Drogo, will do this
I will take my khalasar west, to where the world ends, and ride the wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea, like no khal has done before.
I will kill the men who wear iron suits and tear down their stone houses.
I will rape their women, take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods to Vaes Dothrak.
This I vow, I, Drogo son of Bharbo.
This I swear before the Mother of Mountains, as the stars witness from the heavens.
Aye!
Blood!
For the Khal!
For Drogo!
Death!
Excellent!
I've seen a man last twenty miles.
The earth does not end at the sea.
There are many dirts beyond the sea.
The dirt of my birth.
Not 'dirts': Lands.
Lands, yes…
Burn!
Don't run!
The Lamb Men are never to cross the river.
This is known.
Lamb Men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will drive them west to Meereen or Yunkai, khaleesi.
He will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk and steel.
Go! Move!
Move it!
Shut your mouth!
Walk, sheep man!
If you look at me, I'll kill you, slave!
Let it go!
No! It's mine!
My man killed him! His steel is mine!
Your man's arakh is as dull as a wet mushroom!
Shut up, bitch!
Pull!
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.
Do it by my word, or Khal Drogo will know the excuse.
What are you doing, eunuch!
She's mine!
Get your own!
I'm not finished yet!
I claim this ugly wench! By whose authority do you stop me?
By the authority of the Khaleesi.
No woman orders me!
The Khaleesi took my bitch right from under me!
She did this mid-thrust!
I was fucking the air!
I will not stand for this!
It's an insult!
The Khaleesi will give me my spoils, or I will take them with my arakh!
This is war!
Moon of my life, this is Mago, who rides with the khas of Ko Zhaqo.
He says that you took his spoils, a daughter of the Lamb Men who was his to mount.
Tell me if this is so.
Mago speaks truly, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day, so they might not be mounted.
This is war.
These women are slaves now, and we will do with them as pleases us.
I am pleased to secure them.
If your riders must mount them, then they should marry them.
Give them a place in the khalasar, and then they will bear you sons.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?!
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
See how she grows fierce!
That is my son inside her: The Stallion who will Mount the World, who fills her with his fire.
Mago, I will hear no more.
Find another hole to dig.
My son and stars is hurt…
It's a scratch, Moon of My Life.
I killed the man who cut me.
No man can stand before the sun of my life…
Where are the healers? Why do they not attend the khal?
Many riders hurt.
They should be healed first.
This is the bite of a fly.
A great scar will follow and I will show it to my son.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine. She will speak.
Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
The khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight.
Can you kill some rabbits?
There are no rabbits here.
Find some ducks for me.
She likes ducks.
Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks.
Do you have eyes in your head?
Dog, then. I have seen many dogs!
She said, Anything but horse.
The baby inside her kicks when she eats horse.
It's good for the baby to kick.
Now you know babies?
You're a great wise man who knows about babies?
Moon of my life, Mago says that you took his spoils, a daughter of the Lamb Men who was his to mount.
Tell me if this is so.
You are a foreigner. You do not command me.
I am khaleesi. I do command you.
 khal whom foreign whores order is no khal.
I will not give your body to burn.
I will not honor you thus.
Your body will not be burned.
You will not be honored thus.
The beetles will feed on your eyes and the worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
And when you should arrive at the gates of the Night Lands to beg for eternal rest, then they will laugh you down, and spit on you, and slap your horse.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
Give her to clean your wound, sun and stars of mine.
It hurts me, this seeing that you bleed.
My lord? My sun and stars?
My horse…
Blood of my blood.
No… I must ride…
He fell from his horse.
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.
He's tired, that's all.
He needs to rest.
We've ridden far enough today.
We will camp here.
This is no place to camp.
A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a khaleesi.
We will camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it. Qotho—
You do not command me, Khaleesi.
Bring her to me.
The witch? I'll bring you her head.
Bring her to me, unharmed, or Khal Drogo will hear why you defied me.
Rides… Runs… Wax… My uncle… He gives… No…can blink… Arrows… I…see arrows… Fire… It's a fire… It's red… The sky… The stallion…
He dies.
He will not!
Khaleesi… He fall from horse.
He's too hot. Help me get him in the tub.
This belt against that vest!
No way! No way! My sister made it for me!
Fuck your sister!
Yeah, let's all fuck your sister!
Shut your mouth, fucker!
Fight him, man! Fight him!
You did this, witch!
Stop! I don't want her hurt!
No? You don't want that she be hurt?
Hope that we don't hurt you either.
You gave this woman to touch our khal.
Rein in your tongue.
She is still your khaleesi.
Only while the blood of my blood lives.
When he dies, she is nothing.
I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.
All the dragons are dead.
He's wild!
Easy, easy, easy!
Push!
Pull!
Help us!
No… No… Let me ride…
Hold him!
Khaleesi… Don't do this thing.
Let me kill this witch.
If you kill her, you kill your khal.
This is bloodmagic. It is forbidden.
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.
It's blood magic…
That is blood from the khal's horse.
This is not right.
What has the khaleesi done?
That witch!
The voice burns!
This is evil!
We will die tonight, everyone!
Run! Run!
The fire comes tonight!
The dead walk! They hunger!
The Horse God has been angered!
This must not be.
This will be.
No! You can't!
Stop him! Stop him!
Stallion man. Show me your face.
Let's see this Stallion who will Mount the World!
Leave us alone!
You've brought us destruction!
No further, horselord.
I already gave my bloodword to you, O Khaleesi.
I am the blood from you now.
Is this your command, Khaleesi?
Give me to present my respectful visitors: Viserys from House Targaryen, the third from that name: Rightful King of the Andahls and the First Men.
And his sister Daenerys from House Targaryen.
Moon of my life, are you hurt?
They told me what you did, Jorah the Andal.
Choose any horse you like from my herd.
It is yours. I make this gift to you.
Where is the khaleesi going?
Hand me that carrot, dear.
I need water…
This vest must be washed.
You're quick-witted, dear, but I'm wise.
You should listen to me.
I don't want rabbit today.
Uneaten meat spoils, dear.
You did not leave me.
We already spoke our blood word to you, khaleesi.
We are the blood from you now.
Drogo. My sun and stars.
Leave us.
Do you remember our first ride together, my sun and stars?
If you can hear me, if you haven't yet gone, show me.
You're a fighter.
You've always been a fighter.
I need you to fight now.
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east…
Then you will return, my sun and stars.
You will be my khalasar.
I see the faces of slaves.
I free you.
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.
If you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.
I am Daenerys Stormborn, from the house of Targaryen, from the blood of old Valyria.
I am the daughter of the dragon, and I say my blood word to you that they who hurt you will die with screams.
He shouts like a man, but he pisses like a little boy!
You're right, he's like a goat!
If he comes over here, I'll slap him in the face!
Your beauty burns me.
Let me show you a different kind of dance.
Your tongue is faster than your feet, talkative one!
They shine!
Beautiful!
I can't see!
Be silent!
My bucket's full, mom.
Give it to me, my little light.
Here it is.
So you don't respect me?
I will teach you respect!
Be merciful! Be merciful!
This is mercy! Feel the bite of my mercy!
Do you remember that town?
Yes. It pleases me, that town.
I will never forget it.
Me neither.
Not like Yogo. He'd forget his braid!
It's beautiful, that dun.
I took this horse from a Qartheen.
It's an excellent prize.
Indeed.
The Qartheen are weak.
Yes. We are the true race.
We are the riders!
My father had many excellent horses.
As with my father.
If you had to choose: Your horse or two slaves?
My horse.
Three slaves?
My horse.
Five slaves!
My horse still.
How many slaves are needed to get your horse?
This horse? Every slave on Earth. I love this horse.
Ha! I love my horse too.
Get some water.
All right, I'll go.
This is a good place to camp.
The camp from last night wasn't any good.
The ground was all mud and the air was cold.
What pains that woman?
She looks sickly.
She's not used to riding.
She's not used to being Dothraki.
We should cook now.
Yes. We should.
Winter is coming.
Winter is no good. I like summer.
Me too.
The sun's been obscured by clouds.
The rain will come.
I don't like the rain.
It is known.
She will give birth to a child.
By the great horse god.
The sky smiles on us.
Truly.
His woman should be Dothraki.
Shut your mouth!
Yes, be silent!
Wooo hoo!
Hey Davo! Come over here!
I got fermented mare's milk.
Thanks.
Hey. Check that out!
Crush him, Kogo!
Gralo'll kill him.
To fight is to live!
Got that right!
Shh! Now they must depart.
Here comes Drogo.
She is beautiful.
The khaleesi will be got with child tonight.
This is good for the khalasar.
I don't think this is good.
This doesn't please me.
He should be married to a Dothraki woman.
Shh! Shut your mouth!
This is an excellent day.
That was a great ride.
That was a good day for the Dothraki.
My horse is the best.
After my horse.
Then why do you always follow me?
I don't want you to cry like a baby.
Like a green cloud!
You like to look at my ass.
No, he likes to look at your dapple's ass!
It's smaller than yours.
Drogo's going now.
He's got a hole to dig tonight.
My shovel's ready to go too.
Yours and mine!
A lot of digging today; not much tomorrow. It is known.
For you, maybe: You're a terrible digger.
We should ask the stars to charge for him.
Maybe the new leader will come.
Maybe tonight.
One must try every night.
Kill him!
Look there!
Eyes up!
Come here!
Run!
Behind you!
Over there!
Stop that!
Stop fighting!
Stop them!
Let them fight!
Help him!
No more!
Good thrust.
Good fight.
Excellent fight.
He rode well.
Yes, that's so.
He will ride to the Night Lands.
His star will burn brightly.
Kill him!
Kill him!
You're nothing!
Fight! Fight!
We're going to see guts on the ground tonight!
Slice him up!
He's strong!
He's hurt!
Cut his braid!
Stand up! Are you a man or a boy?
He's fallen!
A great man! A great man!
A wild strike!
Now that's a real man!
We've arrived, by the great horse god.
Vaes Dothrak: The City of Warriors.
I have never seen the gateway.
It's a symbol of our greatness.
We must set up camp before sunset.
The Khal will want a feast tonight.
Tonight the women will dance.
How many miles further? Our horses tire.
They need water.
This satchel is heavy.
Who are they beating?
What has he done?
I don't know.
It seems they thirst for blood and violence.
What are they speaking about?
Why are we stopping?
What has happened?
I cannot see.
Is she leaving?
This will not please Drogo.
Where is she going?
Take his braids off!
Slice his throat!
Pull the tongue from his head!
Stab him!
Slaughter him like swine!
Let's see his guts!
Carve his heart out of his chest!
Show no mercy!
Be good, my child.
I need food.
You always need food!
And you always need a fist to the mouth!
And you both suffer from splinters. No more of this!
Shut your mouth!
Beasts growl; men talk.
It is known.
Is your mother well?
I hope she dies soon.
Really! Why?
Because I hate her.
Why do you hate her?
Because she won't die!
See what I have!
You'll like it!
It's good!
I will get a new vest.
Take this medallion belt with you.
We need some more food.
The new wife of the khal is beautiful.
Jedo is a worthless warrior.
I'm a better rider than Jedo.
Everyone's a better rider than Jedo.
I will take his woman from him.
No! I will do so!
What did he say?
I didn't hear him.
We must go now.
Yes, let's go.
Stay here.
I will come for you soon.
Do you understand?
Be good, my child.
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovvaro. Take our remaining horses.
You will ride east; you southeast; and you northeast.
What do we seek, khaleesi?
Cities, living or dead.
Caravans and people.
Rivers, or lakes, or the Great Salt Sea.
Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.
When I leave this place, I will know where I am going, and how to get there.
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.
It will not gather dust. Let's go.
They killed his soul.
Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
They did! They butchered him like an animal.
They did not burn his body.
He can never join his ancestors in the Night Lands.
Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
This isn't your horse.
It was given to me by the Thirteen—the Elders of Qarth.
Three days to the east, on the sea.
Will they let us in?
They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
Irri, Doreah. Bring him.
I rewove this part of the top.
And I fixed the heel on this one.
Thank you, my friend
May he ride through the Night Lands forever.
You should wear it, Khaleesi.
You are their guest. It would be rude.
Or melt it. Very simple.
We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
Of course not, khaleesi! We will wait until we leave.
Not even when we leave.
Not then? Why?
Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him?
I will hear no more.
I will bring you this sorcerer's head, khaleesi.
Your arakh won't help you against the warlock.
Is he made of blood and bone?
Let me speak with the Andal, blood of my blood.
A house of ghosts, khaleesi. It is known.
Where are the guards?
No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.
Let them try.
You're not here. You cannot be.
But I am. We are.
This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from before I could even…
Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet.
Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.
Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you.
Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
That sounds like something that you would do.
Or maybe it is a dream.
Your dream, my dream… I do not know.
These are questions for wise men with skinny arms.
You are the Moon of my Life.
That is all I know, and all I need to know.
And if this is a dream, I will kill the man who tries to wake me.
The remaining valuables are for loading.
Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one born to it.
It gave him great pride.
Maybe she saw a ghost.
My sister's friend's mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.
Pink people are afraid of the sun.
It burns their skin.
So this pink girl, she probably stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white.
You think she's got white pussy hair, too?
You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?
Only when I was fucking your grandma.
I'll ask Khal Moro for a night with you.
What do you think?
Pretty eyes, but she's an idiot.
She doesn't have to be smart to get fucked in the ass.
I like to talk when I'm finished.
Otherwise, we might as well be dogs.
For you, my Khal.
The white-haired girl we found in the hills.
Look at those lips, blood of my blood.
Blue-eyed women are witches.
It is known.
Cut off her head before she casts a spell on you.
Even if I was blind, I'd hear my wives say, "Cut off her head," and I'd know this woman is beautiful.
I'm glad I'm not blind.
Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time -- what is better than that?
Killing another Khal.
Yes, killing another Khal.
Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.
Breaking a wild horse, forcing a half ton of muscle to submit to your will.
Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time -- it is among the five best things in life.
Do not touch me.
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
You are nobody, the millionth of your name, Queen of Nothing, slave of Khal Moro.
Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind you will give me a son.
Do you understand?
I will not lie with you.
And I will bear no children, for you or anyone else.
Not until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
I told you she is a witch.
Cut off her head.
I like her.
She has spirit.
I was wife to Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo.
Khal Drogo is dead.
I know.
I burnt his body.
Forgive me.
I did not know.
It is forbidden to lie with a Khal's widow.
No one will touch you, you have my word.
If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses as a sign of my gratitude.
When a khal dies, there is only place for his khaleesi.
Vaes Dothrak.
The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.
To live out her days with the widows of dead khals.
It is known.
Hey, Great Khaleesi.
Move your ass.
Welcome home, khaleesi.
Go.
What are you doing?!
Take your hands off me!
I will have your heads!
I am the Mother of Dragons!
My son was the Stallion Who Mounts the World!
I am wife of Khal Drogo!
You beasts!
You have made a mistake.
One you will regret.
I am the wife of the Great Khal.
We know who you are.
I remember you eating the stallion's heart.
Why didn't you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons.
My place is not here with you.
Maybe you're right.
You were the wife of the Great Khal.
You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side.
You thought you would give birth to the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
He didn't.
You didn't.
I was the wife of the Great Khal.
Khal Savo.
I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side.
Have you heard the stories about him?
No.
You haven't.
You're young.
We were all young, once.
Some of us still are.
But we all understand the way things are.
You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.
Where else would I go?
Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
Yes.
Immediately after the death of their khal.
But you did not.
You went out into the world.
That is forbidden.
All the khalasars have returned to the ancient city for the Khalar Vezhven, where they will meet to discuss their plans for the coming winter.
They will decide which cities will be sacked, which tribes will be enslaved, and which ones destroyed.
And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow.
With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons.
It is the best you can hope for, now.
You bring any girls home from Saath?
Mm, a little beauty with red hair.
What if you have a son with red hair?
I'll throw him in the river.
My friends... We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost.
Could you show us the way back?
What do you sell?
Wine.
Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give a cask of the Arbor's finest.
You're not merchants.
Get the others.
Help!
Help!
Some of them don't think Dothraki should breed with foreigners.
They don't think the blood should be diluted.
They are stupid old women.
They don't realize that we have always diluted our blood.
We conquer a people, we take the best women, they bear us children.
That's how we stay strong.
This one is Lhazareen.
Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village.
How old were you?
Twelve.
A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter.
He must have been so happy.
How did he show his happiness?
He broke my ribs.
We are not queens, here.
We do not conquer cities or ride dragons.
But do not despair.
The khals depend on us for our wisdom.
Our lives have meaning.
And we have each other.
That is more than most have.
When the Khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven, I hope they let you live out your days with us.
The other possibilities are not so pleasant.
And the Khalar Vezhven is tomorrow night?
I need to make water.
You can't run from Dothraki.
You know this.
I will never run from Dothraki.
Go, show her.
I needed fresh air.
The old women stink.
They do stink.
You must have been very young when your Khal died.
Sixteen.
Too bad he didn't die sooner.
Yes, too bad.
Is it true you have three dragons?
And they breathe fire?
They do.
Would you like to see them one day?
I am Dosh Khaleen.
I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, unless I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.
And you... Have faith in me, khaleesi.
Do not betray me.
Your horses trampled my man Iggo.
He was better at healing horses than any man in my khalasar.
They also trampled my man Akho.
Even worse, I lost two mares and a stallion.
What's worth more: two mares and a stallion, or two men dumb enough to get trampled by horses?
Fuck them both.
You should thank my horses.
It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city.
It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
So we don't spill blood!
Well... There's always a little blood.
Someone crushed his head with a rock--
Aggo was not killed with a blade.
But his blood was spilled.
There is always some blood.
Not when you strangle them.
Or break their neck.
Or roll them in a rug and trample them with a horse.
The law states that--
Aggo belonged to my khalasar.
He served me well.
He got his head smashed in by a rock.
Fuck Aggo.
Bring in Drogo's widow.
Who cares about her?
She's a midget.
I like her.
She's paler than milk.
I bet she gets nice and pink when you pinch her.
I'd like to know what a Khaleesi tastes like.
Good.
You can suck my dick.
She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her.
They're offering ten thousand horses in exchange.
What's worth more: one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?
Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses.
Tell me where their horses are and I'll take them for myself.
She should stay here.
It's our tradition.
She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
Don't you want to know what I think?
You'd rather be sold into slavery?
Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
No, I don't want either of those things.
We don't care what you want.
This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.
You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen.
Which you are not, until we decide you are.
I know where I am.
I have been here before.
Right there, on that spot, I ate a stallion's heart.
And the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
And what happened?
You trusted a sorceress, like a fool.
Your baby is dead because of you.
And so is Khal Drogo.
This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends.
To ride wooden horses across the black salt sea as no khal has done before.
He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses.
He swore it to me.
Before the Mother of Mountains, as the stars looked down in witness.
And you were dumb enough to believe him.
And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss?
Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute.
You are small men.
Under you, the Dothraki will be a small people.
None of you is fit to lead them.
But I am.
So I will.
All right.
No Dosh Khaleen for you.
Your choice.
Instead, we'll take turns fucking you.
And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.
And if there's anything left of you, we'll give our horses a turn.
Have you ever seen what a horse does to a woman?
This is a thing you should see before you die.
And you will.
Right before you die.
You crazy cunt.
Did you really think we would serve you?
You're not going to serve.
You're going to die.
I'm going after her.
Wait for me here.
Every khal who ever lived chose three bloodriders to fight beside him and guard his way.
But I am not a khal.
I will not choose three bloodriders.
I choose you all.
I ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.
Blood of my blood!
Blood of my blood!
I will ask more of you than any Khal has ever asked of his khalasar!
Blood of my blood!
Blood of my blood!
Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains as the stars looked down in witness?
Are you with me, now and always?!
Escort these men to their rooms.
Treat them well, but keep an eye on them.
Strength!
Attack!
Charge!
Blood of my blood!
For honor!
For the khaleesi!
By blood!
By my arakh!
Die!
By my steed!
Death to the foreigners!
By the dragons!
This man says he is your friend, khaleesi.
He is my friend.
Your friend knew how to dress.
Too bad he didn't know how to fight.
To my son, the Stallion Who Will Mount the World, to him I also pledge a gift.
To him I will give this iron chair his mother's father sat in.
I will give Seven Kingdoms.
How many today?
Twelve goats.
Three sheep.
Raise your arakhs!
Blood of my blood!
You kept all your promises to me.
You killed my enemies in their iron suits!
You tore down their stone houses!
You have given me the Seven Kingdoms!
Get ready!
Get ready!
